This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using a Deque data structure.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

A Deque (Double Ended Queue) allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear ends.

Each character of the input string is inserted into the deque.

The program removes characters simultaneously from the front and rear.

The removed characters are compared to verify palindrome property.

If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.

If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.

This approach is optimized because it uses a single data structure instead of stack and queue.

The program demonstrates efficient use of deque for real-world problem solving.
