This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using a singly linked list.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

The input string is converted into a linked list where each character is stored as a node.

The program uses the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.

After finding the middle, the second half of the list is reversed in place.

The first half and the reversed second half are compared node by node.

If all corresponding nodes match, the string is a palindrome.

If any mismatch occurs, the string is not a palindrome.

This approach uses no extra memory for reversal, making it efficient.

The program demonstrates linked list traversal, in-place reversal, and efficient problem solving.
