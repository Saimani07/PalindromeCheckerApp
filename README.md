This program compares the performance of different palindrome checking methods.

It demonstrates how multiple algorithms can solve the same problem.

The input string is normalized by removing spaces and converting to lowercase.

The first method checks palindrome using string reversal.

The second method checks palindrome using a stack.

Execution time for each method is measured using System.nanoTime().

The start and end times are recorded for accurate comparison.

The program displays whether the string is a palindrome for each method.

It also prints the execution time taken by each algorithm.

This program helps in understanding algorithm efficiency and performance analysis.
