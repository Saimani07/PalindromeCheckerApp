UC6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Checker App — README (10 Points)

The program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using Queue and Stack data structures.

A palindrome is a word or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., madam, racecar).

The application demonstrates the difference between FIFO (Queue) and LIFO (Stack) principles.

A Queue follows First In First Out, where the first inserted element is removed first.

A Stack follows Last In First Out, where the last inserted element is removed first.

Each character of the input string is inserted into both the queue and the stack.

Characters are removed simultaneously using dequeue (queue) and pop (stack) operations.

The removed characters are compared one by one to verify palindrome logic.

If all corresponding characters match, the string is declared a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

This program helps in understanding stacks, queues, and their real-world application in problem solving.
