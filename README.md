This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using recursion.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.

The program compares the first and last characters of the string.

If the characters match, the function calls itself for the remaining substring.

If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.

The base condition stops recursion when the start index becomes greater than or equal to the end index.

The recursive calls are managed using the call stack in memory.

Non-alphanumeric characters can be removed to ensure accurate comparison.

This program demonstrates recursive problem solving and efficient string processing.
