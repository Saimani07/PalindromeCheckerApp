This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome while ignoring spaces and case differences.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

The input string is first preprocessed to remove all spaces.

All characters are converted to lowercase for uniform comparison.

This ensures that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated equally.

The program compares characters from the beginning and end of the string.

The comparison continues towards the center of the string.

If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.

If any mismatch occurs, the string is not a palindrome.

This program demonstrates string preprocessing and efficient palindrome checking.
