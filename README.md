# PalindromeCheckerApp

* Displays whether a predefined (hardcoded) string is a palindrome
* No user input is required
* Program starts execution from the `main()` method
* A fixed string literal (e.g., "madam") is stored in a variable
* The string is checked against its reverse
* Uses an `if-else` conditional statement for validation
* Prints the result to the console using `System.out.println()`
* Program terminates after displaying the output
* Demonstrates basic Java concepts: class, main method, String, conditionals
* Useful for understanding palindrome logic with simple implementation
